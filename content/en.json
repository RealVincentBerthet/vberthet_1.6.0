First of all, I have started as a self-educated and I did many projects to discover deeper both fields.</p><p>Thatâ€™s why, I have decided to continue my studies in a first time in Electrical Engineering & Industrial Computing during 2 years, in order to discover fields like automation, electronic, embeded computing which were fields that interested myself.</p><p>Finaly, I decided to forward in the computing. Instead of chose directly an engineering school, I have prefered to take the chance to study a year in a foreign country, in order to improve my english which is a very important skill in this professional field as well in the daily life !</p><p>Moreover, I believe that this human experience to discover deeper myself, an other culture, international people, way of work, lifestyle, and also one of the specifities of computing (Game Development) is a great opportunity for me. </p> <p>Furthermore, I am sure about that this experience will help me in my project of study after this year.</p><p>Cheers</p>"
